Types

A rough definition of a type in JavaScript is: "an intrinsic, built-in set of characteristics that uniquely identifies the behavior of a particular value and distinguishes it from other values, both to the engine and to the developer."

-Built-in Types-
The seven built-in JS types are: null, undefined, boolean, number, string, object, symbol (new in ES6). All of these are considered primitives, except for `object`.
The `typeof` operator inspects a given value and returns the type. `null` is buggy and returns a value of `"object"`. It should return `"null"` but the bug has existed for so long that changing it would cause a lot of harm to legacy code, so it is left as is.
To test a `null` value using its type, you need to create a compound condition that, in addition, checks the value's falsiness, as `null` is the only "falsy" primitive value that returns a `typeof` of "object".
Functions, although considered a subtype of `object`, are also identified by `typeof`. Functions are considred "callable objects" in JS, as they have an internal [[[Call]]] property, allowing them to be invoked.
Because functions are objects, they can have properties, which include the parameters they were declared with. This is useful if you want to run an object utility such as `.length` on a function.
Arrays are also considered a subtype of `object`, with the included ability to be numerically indexed.

-Values as Types-
Values have types in JS, rather than variables. Variables can hold any value, therefore they can hold any type.
The type of value a variable can hold is mutable. You can think of this as JS not having "type enforcement".
A value's type cannot be changed. Coercion is the act of creating a new value from a value of a different type. `typeof` is simply checking the type of the value contained in a variable.

-`undefined` vs "undeclared"-
A variable that has been declared, but currently has no other value associated with it, has a value of `undefined`.
An undeclared variable is a variable that has not been formally declared in the accessible scope.
Some browsers will return a warning that a variable has not been defined when in fact it hasn't even been declared. The `typeof` operator also has a safeguard that engages in a similar behavior, so be aware.
