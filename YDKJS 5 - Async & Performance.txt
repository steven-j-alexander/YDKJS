Asynchrony: Now & Later

-A Program In Chunks-
A JS program consists of several chunks, with some chunks running in the "present", and the rest running "later". A common type of a chunk unit is a function.
Asynchronous tasks do not block until completion, whereas synchronous tasks do. Ajax requests complete asynchronously. Requests are made in the present and the results are returned later.
The simplest way to block and wait from now until later when a return is recieved is to use a callback function.
While it is possible to make Ajax requests synchronously, it locks the browser UI, preventing user interaction. It is best avoided.
"Later" (asynchronous) code chunks are often functions that are set to run as a response to specific circumstances (timer or click event, Ajax response, etc).
